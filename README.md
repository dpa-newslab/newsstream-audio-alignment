# Newsstream Audio Alignment

How can aligned audio be used to enhance multimedia storytelling? 

See for yourself: http://dpa-newslab.github.io/newsstream-audio-alignment/

A demo built for the [Newsstream Project](http://newsstreamproject.org/).

## Prior Art

The whole project was inspired by the awsome inline audio player from [SoundCite](https://soundcite.knightlab.com/). 

The alignment of text and audio is done by our partners at [Fraunhofer IAIS](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/?L=1).

The HTML / CSS / JS of the site is based on Shiori, a simply pretty Bootstrap-based Jekyll Theme by [Elle Kasai](http://github.com/ellekasai). Here's the [Demo Site](http://ellekasai.github.io/shiori).
